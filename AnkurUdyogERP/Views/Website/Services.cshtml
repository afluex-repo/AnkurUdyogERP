                                                The sponge iron manufacturing process starts with the sizing of the Iron ore and Coal as
                                                required for the manufacturing through its raw material handling circuits comprising of a series of conveyors/screens/crushers. This sized iron ore and coal is then stored into silos from where
                                                to is fed into the sponge iron kilns. Iron ore travels through the entire length of the kiln with coal
                                                which is used to maintain required temperature in different zones of the kiln enabling deoxidation of iron ore and thus conversion into sponge iron. During the process dolomite is
                                                injected into kiln to reduce Sulphur levels in sponge iron. A lab established in the department
                                                controls the quality of inward raw material i.e. iron ore and coal as well as finished sponge iron in
                                                all respects. Thus this good quality sponge iron produced ultimately results in better chemical
                                                composition of finished products. This sponge iron produced act as a raw material for next
                                                stage of manufacturing process - the steel Melt Shop.
